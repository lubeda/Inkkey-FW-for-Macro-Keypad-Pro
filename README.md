# Inkkey-FW-for-Macro-Keypad-Pro-
a modified Firmware for the Macro Keypad Pro to use with inkkeys (https://there.oughta.be/a/macro-keyboard)like PC-Software

I'm lazy so i bought the very nice hardware from https://www.tindie.com/products/phoenixcnc/6-key-macro-keypad-with-rotary-encoder-and-display/ the build in software i also nice but not as it should be.

I found this hard and software where i like the software very much but am to lazy to build the hardware for it. So i tried to merge both things together. This is the repo for the arduino firmware to run on the hardware from hayri.

I adapted the code from t.o.b to use the 15 leds from the hardware and made it able to set the keycap color and display some text on the color display.

This is the first relase. There is space for improvement, so i would like to use icons on the display....
